Replace WordPress default login/register page logo with custom one.

== Description ==

Using Custom Logo you can replace WP default login/register page logo by placing URL to custom logo 
you have (in proper size of course ;)). It is done using JavaScript onload event. It is not ideal, because 
there is small delay. I will try to improve it as soon as possible(I created it because of need for one small 
project...). Reason for using approach is seamless WP upgrades without any need for backup wp-admin.css or 
changed wordpress-logo.png.

== Installation ==

Upload the plugin directory to your wp-content/plugins/ and activate it. All done.
